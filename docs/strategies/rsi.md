### The `rsi` strategy

Attempts to buy low and sell high by tracking RSI high-water readings.

- Effective in sideways markets or markets that tend to recover after price drops.
- Risky to use in bear markets, since the algorithm depends on price recovery.
- If the other strategies are losing you money, this strategy may perform better, since it basically "reverses the signals" and anticipates a reversal instead of expecting the trend to continue.
