### The `macd` strategy

The moving average convergence divergence calculation is a lagging indicator, used to follow trends.

- Can be very effective for trading periods of 1h, with a shorter period like 15m it seems too erratic and the Moving Averages are kind of lost.
- It's not firing multiple 'buy' or 'sold' signals, only one per trend, which seems to lead to a better quality trading scheme.
- Especially when the bot will enter in the middle of a trend, it avoids buying unless it's the beginning of the trend.
