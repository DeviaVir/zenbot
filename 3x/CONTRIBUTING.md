# Contributing to Zenbot 3

- Anything in [plugins](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/tree/master/plugins) is fair game for submitting Pull Requests
- This includes new exchange support you want to add. If you want to add an exchange, look at [gdax](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/tree/master/plugins/gdax) as an example. Fork zenbot repo, add your exchange, and submit a Pull Request.
- Zenbot's [core](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/tree/master/core) is made up of plugins. Examine it to learn how plugins work!
- To peak under the hood, check out [Zenbrain](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbrain)!
- Pull Requests for documentation, bug fixes, etc. are also appreciated.
- We're in the process of setting up a [Gratipay team](https://gratipay.com/Zenbot-3/). Through this, it might be possible for you to get paid for working on Zenbot!
- Zenbot is a hobby/passion project. Donations in BTC are appreciated! See the bottom of [README](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/blob/master/README.md) for details.
