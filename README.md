## Zenbot

Dear reader, unfortunately due to the absence of the original owner (@carlos8f) we have decided to migrate the repository to a new repository which is in control of the collaborators. Please see the new repository for current and active development.

https://github.com/highvelocitoryspace/zenbot

Make sure to create new issues and PR's in that repository.

Thank you, and see you on the other side.
