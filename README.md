## Current Status

Zenbot 4 is functional, but is having trouble reliably making profit. At this point, **I would recommend against trading with large amounts** until some of these issues can be worked out:

- Many people are reporting [losses in live trading](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/issues/189) even if the simulation results and/or paper trading is positive.
- This is my highest priority right now, since an unprofitable bot is not worth much, but please understand that reliably making profit is hard, and so is making a realistic simulator.
- The losses may be due to the default strategy not working well in sideways (non-trending) market conditions, slippage during limit order execution, or both. Currently I would recommend against using Zenbot on a market that is non-trending or trending generally downwards.
- The limit-order strategy that Zenbot uses to avoid taker fees, is prone to race conditions and delays. A mode for using market-type orders will probably need to be made, which may make frequent-trade strategies less viable due to fees, but more reliable execution overall.
- An upcoming feature will allow Zenbot to use a limited amount of your balance, which will help with experimenting with live trading, but mitigating the possible losses from the issues above.

Zenbot is a hobby project for me and I'm sorry that I can't devote myself full-time to it. Since I'm getting busier, development may slow down a bit from here, so please be patient if issues aren't fixed right away.

## Description

Zenbot is a command-line cryptocurrency trading bot using Node.js and MongoDB. It features:

- Fully-automated [technical-analysis](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:introduction_to_technical_indicators_and_oscillators)-based trading approach
- Full support for [GDAX](https://gdax.com/), [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com), [Kraken](https://kraken.com/), [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/), [Quadriga](https://www.quadrigacs.com), [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com), [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com), [CEX.IO](https://cex.io/trade) and [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/), work on further exchange support is ongoing.
- Plugin architecture for implementing exchange support, or writing new strategies
- Simulator for [Backtesting strategies](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/b09a734cf626ffb9bb3bcb1ca35f3db4) against historical data
- "Paper" trading mode, operates on a simulated balance while watching the live market
- Configurable sell stops, buy stops, and (trailing) profit stops
- Flexible sampling period and trade frequency - averages 1-2 trades/day with 1h period, 15-50/day with 5m period

## Disclaimer

- Zenbot is NOT a sure-fire profit machine. Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Zenbot. Meaning, both may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.
- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Zenbot doesn't know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.
- Often times the default trade parameters will underperform vs. a buy-hold strategy, so run some simulations and find the optimal parameters for your chosen exchange/pair before going "all-in".

## Quick-start

### Step 1) Requirements

- Windows / Linux / macOS 10 (or Docker)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 8 or higher) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Step 2) Install zenbot 4

Run in your console,

```
git clone https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot.git
```

Or, without git,

```
wget https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -xf zenbot-master.tar.gz
mv zenbot-master zenbot
```

Create your configuration file by copying `conf-sample.js` to `conf.js`:

```
cp conf-sample.js conf.js
```

- View and edit `conf.js`.
- It's possible to use zenbot in "paper trading" mode without making any changes.
- You must add your exchange API keys to enable real trading however.
- API keys do NOT need deposit/withdrawl permissions.

If using Docker, skip to section "Docker" below.

Install dependencies:

```
cd zenbot
npm install
# optional, installs the `zenbot.sh` binary in /usr/local/bin:
npm link
```

### Ubuntu 16.04 Step-By-Step
https://youtu.be/BEhU55W9pBI
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential mongodb -y

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

git clone https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot.git
cd zenbot
npm install

./zenbot.sh trade --paper
```
Please note; npm link will not work as forex.analytics is built from source.

### Docker (Optional)

To run Zenbot under Docker, install Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Machine (if necessary) You can follow instructions at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

After installing (step 2 above),

```
cd zenbot
docker-compose build
docker-compose up (-d if you don't want to see the log)
```

If you are running windows use the following command

```
docker-compose --file=docker-compose-windows.yml up
```

If you wish to run commands (e.g. backfills, list-selectors), you can run this separate command after a successful `docker-compose up -d`:

```
docker-compose exec server zenbot list-selectors
docker-compose exec server zenbot backfill <selector> --days <days>
```

## Selectors

A "selector" is a short identifier that tells Zenbot which exchange and currency pair to act on. Use the form `{exchange_slug}.{asset}-{currency}`. A complete list of selectors your Zenbot install supports can be found with:

```
zenbot list-selectors

gdax:
  gdax.BTC-EUR   (BTC/EUR)
  gdax.BTC-GBP   (BTC/GBP)
  gdax.BTC-USD   (BTC/USD)
  gdax.ETH-BTC   (ETH/BTC)
  gdax.ETH-USD   (ETH/USD)
  gdax.LTC-BTC   (LTC/BTC)
  gdax.LTC-USD   (LTC/USD)

poloniex:
  poloniex.AMP-BTC   (Synereo AMP/BTC)
  poloniex.ARDR-BTC   (Ardor/BTC)
  poloniex.BCN-BTC   (Bytecoin/BTC)
  poloniex.BCN-XMR   (Bytecoin/XMR)
  poloniex.BCY-BTC   (BitCrystals/BTC)

...etc
```

## Run a simulation for your selector

To backfill data (provided that your chosen exchange supports it), use:

```
zenbot backfill <selector> --days <days>
```

After you've backfilled, you can run a simulation:

```
zenbot sim <selector> [options]
```

For a list of options for the `sim` command, use:

```
zenbot sim --help

```

For additional options related to the strategy, use:

```
zenbot list-strategies
```

- By default the sim will start with 1000 units of currency. Override with `--currency_capital` and `--asset_capital`.
- Open `sim_result.html` in your browser to see a candlestick graph with trades.

### Screenshot and example result

Zenbot outputs an HTML graph of each simulation result. In the screenshot below, the pink arrows represent the bot buying (up arrow) and selling (down arrow) as it iterated the historical data of [GDAX](https://gdax.com/) exchange's BTC/USD product.

![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/106763/25983930/7e5f9436-369c-11e7-971b-ba2916442eea.png)

```
end balance 2954.50 (195.45%)
buy hold 1834.44 (83.44%)
vs. buy hold 61.06%
110 trades over 91 days (avg 1.21 trades/day)
```

Zenbot started with $1,000 USD and ended with $2,954.50 after 90 days, making 195% ROI! In spite of a buy/hold strategy returning a respectable 83.44%, Zenbot has considerable potential for beating buy/holders.

- Note that this example used tweaked settings to achieve optimal return: `--profit_stop_enable_pct=10`, `--profit_stop_pct=4`, `trend_ema=36`, and `--sell_rate=-0.006`. Default parameters yielded around 65% ROI.

## Running zenbot

The following command will launch the bot, and if you haven't touched `c.selector` in `conf.js`, will trade the default BTC/USD pair on GDAX.

```
zenbot trade [--paper] [--manual]
```

Use the `--paper` flag to only perform simulated trades while watching the market.

Use the `--manual` flag to watch the price and account balance, but do not perform trades automatically.

Here's how to run a different selector (example: ETH-BTC on Poloniex):

```
zenbot trade poloniex.eth-btc
```

For a full list of options for the `trade` command, use:

```
zenbot trade --help

## Interactive controls

While the `trade` command is running, Zenbot will respond to these keypress commands:

- Pressing `b` will trigger a buy, `s` for sell, and `B` and `S` for market (taker) orders.
- Pressing `c` or `C` will cancel any active orders.
- Pressing `m` or `M` will toggle manual mode (`--manual`)

These commands can be used to override what the bot is doing. Or, while running with the `--manual` flag, this allows you to make all the trade decisions yourself.

## Conf/argument override files

To run `trade` or `sim` commands with a pre-defined set of options, use:

```
zenbot trade --conf <path>
```

Where `<path>` points to a JS file that exports an object hash that overrides any conf or argument variables. For example, this file will run gdax.ETH-USD with options specific for that market:

```
var c = module.exports = {}

// ETH settings (note: this is just an example, not necessarily recommended)
c.selector = 'gdax.ETH-USD'
c.period = '10m'
c.trend_ema = 20
c.neutral_rate = 0.1
c.oversold_rsi_periods = 20
c.max_slippage_pct = 10
c.order_adjust_time = 10000
```

- Gain or loss vs. buy/hold strategy

## Strategies

### The `trend_ema` strategy (default)

- The default strategy is called `trend_ema` and resides at `./extensions/strategies/trend_ema`.
- Defaults to using a 2m period, but you can override this with adding e.g. `--period=5m` to the `sim` or `trade` commands.
- Computes the 26-period EMA of the current price, and calculates the percent change from the last period's EMA to get the `trend_ema_rate`
- Considers `trend_ema_rate >= 0` an upwards trend and `trend_ema_rate < 0` a downwards trend
- Filters out low values (whipsaws) by `neutral_rate`, which when set to `auto`, uses the standard deviation of the `trend_ema_rate` as a variable noise filter.
- Buys at the beginning of upwards trend, sells at the beginning of downwards trend
- If `oversold_rsi` is set, tries to buy when the RSI dips below that value, and then starts to recover (a counterpart to `--profit_stop_enable_pct`, which sells when a percent of profit is reached, and then dips)
- The bot will always try to avoid trade fees, by using post-only orders and thus being a market "maker" instead of a "taker". Some exchanges will, however, not offer maker discounts.

### The `macd` strategy

The moving average convergence divergence calculation is a lagging indicator, used to follow trends.

- Can be very effective for trading periods of 1h, with a shorter period like 15m it seems too erratic and the Moving Averages are kind of lost.
- It's not firing multiple 'buy' or 'sold' signals, only one per trend, which seems to lead to a better quality trading scheme.
- Especially when the bot will enter in the middle of a trend, it avoids buying unless it's the beginning of the trend.

### The `rsi` strategy

Attempts to buy low and sell high by tracking RSI high-water readings.

- Effective in sideways markets or markets that tend to recover after price drops.
- Risky to use in bear markets, since the algorithm depends on price recovery.
- If the other strategies are losing you money, this strategy may perform better, since it basically "reverses the signals" and anticipates a reversal instead of expecting the trend to continue.

### The `sar` strategy

Uses a [Parabolic SAR](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:parabolic_sar) indicator to trade when SAR trend reverses.

- Tends to generate earlier signals than EMA-based strategies, resulting in better capture of highs and lows, and better protection against quick price drops.
- Does not perform well in sideways (non-trending) markets, generating more whipsaws than EMA-based strategies.
- Most effective with short period (default is 2m), which means it generates 50-100 trades/day, so only usable on GDAX (with 0% maker fee) at the moment.
- Tested live, [results here](https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/pull/246#issuecomment-307528347)

### The `speed` strategy

Trade when % change from last two 1m periods is higher than average.

**This strategy is experimental and has WILDLY varying sim results. NOT RECOMMENDED YET.**

- Like the sar strategy, this generates early signals and can be effective in volatile markets and for sudden price drop protection.
- Its weakness is that it performs very poorly in low-volatility situations and misses signals from gradually developing trends.

### Tips for tweaking options

- Trade frequency is adjusted with a combination of `--period` and `--trend_ema`. For example, if you want more frequent trading, try `--period=5m` or `--trend_ema=15` or both. If you get too many ping-pong trades or losses from fees, try increasing `period` or `trend_ema` or increasing `neutral_rate`.
- Sometimes it's tempting to tell the bot trade very often. Try to resist this urge, and go for quality over quantity, since each trade comes with a decent amount of slippage and whipsaw risk.
- `--oversold_rsi=<rsi>` will try to buy when the price dives. This is one of the ways to get profit above buy/hold, but setting it too high might result in a loss of the price continues to fall.
- In a market with predictable price surges and corrections, `--profit_stop_enable_pct=10` will try to sell when the last buy hits 10% profit and then drops to 9% (the drop % is set with `--profit_stop_pct`). However in strong, long uptrends this option may end up causing a sell too early.
- For Kraken and GDAX you may wish to use `--order_type="taker"`, this uses market orders instead of limit orders. You usually pay a higher fee, but you can be sure that your order is filled instantly. This means that the sim will more closely match your live trading. Please note that GDAX does not charge maker fees (limit orders), so you will need to choose between not paying fees and running the risk orders do not get filled on time, or paying somewhat high % of fees and making sure your orders are always filled on time.

## Manual trade tools

Zenbot's order execution engine can also be used for manual trades. Benefits include:

- Avoids market-order fees by using a short-term limit order
- Can automatically determine order size from account balance
- Adjusts order every 30s (if needed) to ensure quick execution
- If an order is partially filled, attempts to re-order with remaining size

The command to buy is:

```
zenbot buy <selector> [--size=<size>] [--pct=<pct>]
```

For example, to use your remaining USD balance in GDAX to buy Bitcoin:

```
zenbot buy gdax.BTC-USD
```

Or to sell 10% of your BTC,

```
zenbot sell gdax.BTC-USD --pct=10
```
